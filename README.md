Holds memory address of another variable.\
Useful for allowing functions to modify variables outside their local scope and for efficient handling of large data structures.

Key concepts:

- Declaration: Use the \* operator to declare a pointer type.
- Initialization: Use the & operator to get the address of a variable.
- Dereferencing: Use the \* operator to access the value stored at the address.
